Getting the environment up and ready
Make sure that you have docker-compose installed(installation instructions).

To start the lab environment you can do either of the following two:

To use the prebuilt images run: docker-compose up -d and point your browser to http://localhost
To build the images yourself locally run: docker-compose -f docker-compose-builder.yml up -d and point your browser to http://localhost
Things to note:

The setup currently is in Bring Your Own Cluster state.
If your reload the exam.html it will reset the timer as the timer currently being used is jQuery based. - solution WIP
Since we are using jQuery to initialize and connect to GateOne therefore the application needs to be reachable from your browser host on port 8080. - solution WIP
